### Structure

* Final report: `./report.pdf`
* All the necessary code is provided in the directory `./src`
* Examples of the method application are provided in jupyter-notebooks:
    - experiment on a small Sales-Pardo graph with visualization: `example_sp_graph_toy.ipynb`
    - experiment on a bigger Sales-Pardo graph reproducing results provided in the original paper: `example_sp_graph.ipynb`
    - experiment on a non-uniform swiss roll manifold: `example_suiss_roll.ipynb`
* All plots and graphs' visualizations are saved to the directory `./plots`
